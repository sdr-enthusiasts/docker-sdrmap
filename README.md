Docker container running [SDR Map's](http://sdrmap.org) feeder scripts. Designed to work in tandem with [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder). Builds and runs on `x86_64`, `arm64`, and `arm32v7`.

## Obtaining credentials to feed

Please visit [feeding](https://github.com/sdrmap/docs/wiki/2.1-Feeding) for instructions on how to obtain credentials to feed. Once you have credentials (a username and password), you can proceed with setting up the container.

## Up-and-Running with Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  sdrmap:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-sdrmap:latest
    container_name: sdrmap
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - BEASTHOST=ultrafeeder
      - LAT=-33.33333
      - LON=111.11111
      - ALT=99
      - SMUSERNAME=yourusername
      - SMPASSWORD=yourpassword
      - SEND_SYSINFO=true
      - MLAT_PRIVACY=false
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
      - /run:exec,size=64M
      - /var/log
```

## MLAT

MLAT is enabled by default. If you want to disable MLAT, you need to set the `MLAT` environment variable to `false`.

For MLAT to work, make sure to include the `ALT` environment variable with the altitude of your antenna in meters. For example, if your antenna is 10 meters above sea level, you would set `ALT=10`. If your `ALT` parameter is not set, MLAT will not work.

You will want to send mlat results to ultrafeeder using this environment variable:

```yaml
- MLAT_RESULTS=beast,connect,ultrafeeder:31004
```

The container also provides MLAT results on port 30105. Alternatively, you could pull these results from the SDRMap container. For Ultrafeeder, this would mean adding a line to the `ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG` parameter like this:

```yaml
- ULTRAFEEDER_CONFIG=
    ...
    mlathub,sdrmap,30105,beast_in;
```

### MLAT Privacy

> [!WARNING]
> When MLAT is enabled, you station position (rounded to 2 decimals for lat/lon) is shown on the SDRMap website, which means it will be accurate within about 1 km.
> If you would rather not show your station position at all, set `MLAT_PRIVACY` to `true`

## Runtime Environment Variables

There are a series of available environment variables:
